I have used my own javascript file in addition to js provided by bootstrap for two reasons.
    1. one is for a ecommerce gallery on the shop page of the website. for changing the main image of the gallery on click of the small images under it 
    2. I have used js for form validation, I wanted to validate my forms when the user tries to submit
